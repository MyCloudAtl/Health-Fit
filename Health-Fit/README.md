# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Project Outline
Project Name: HealthFit 
Description: Our web application, HealthFit will allow users to record, store, and manage their personal health intake and goals. Users can upload their daily intake, track their gym activities, set goals, and help them maintain a log of their personal fit life. The application will be integrated with a clean, responsive design with 

Technologies Used:
Frontend: Axios, Bootstrap, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), HTML5, React-Bootstrap, React-Big-Calendar(Date-fns & DatePicker) React.js, React Router, Vite
Middleware: Body-Parser, Morgan, Express-Session
Backend: CORS, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose), Node.js, Passport(Passport-Local & Passport-local-Mongoose) 
Tools: Git, GitHub, Trello, Lucid 

Project Setup
Backend Setup:
Create a new repository for the backend (bookshelf-backend) on GitHub.
Initialize Node.js project (npm init), install necessary packages (express, mongoose, etc.).
Define Mongoose models for User and Book.
Implement CRUD operations for managing books and users.
Set up RESTful API endpoints (/api/books, /api/users) for frontend interaction.
Frontend Setup:
Create a new repository for the frontend (bookshelf-frontend) on GitHub.
Set up React.js project (npx create-react-app client), organize components and routes.
Design reusable UI components for book display, forms (add/edit), navigation.
Integrate Axios for API calls to the backend.
Implement CRUD functionalities for books (list, add, edit, delete).
Integration:
Connect frontend and backend using Axios to fetch and update book data.
Ensure proper error handling and validation on both ends.
Implement user authentication (optional) using JWT tokens and secure routes.
Design and User Experience:
Create wireframes and design mockups using tools like Figma or Adobe XD.
Implement a responsive design using CSS Flexbox/Grid for layout.
Focus on usability and intuitive user interactions (e.g., forms, buttons, modals).
Documentation and Deployment:
Write a detailed README.md with project overview, setup instructions, screenshots, and future updates.
Include ERD, Component Hierarchy Diagram, and Trello board links in the README.
Deploy frontend (Netlify, Vercel) and backend (Heroku) applications.
Test deployment to ensure all functionalities work in a live environment.
Project Management
Trello Board: Use a Trello board to track tasks, goals, and responsibilities for each team member. Define milestones for frontend and backend development, allocate tasks accordingly.
Git Workflow: Utilize Git for version control with meaningful commit messages. Maintain separate branches for features and merge them via pull requests after code review.

Future Updates
